Duplicate the runcard: production + warmup
Logs will be created in a dedicated logs/ folder.

To check if all the jobs have been done with no errors run 
>>> check_err.sh logs/ (--print)

To generate a full set of folders for a standard NNLOJET run
at NNLO you can use 
>>> setchannels.sh <runcard_name> (R V etc., if any makes all)
